# BiSim
BiSim Tool: a binding simulation tool to aid and simplify ligand binding assay design and development 
# Introduction 
This simulation tool, developed in R, supports mathematical calculations of protein binding interactions 
occurring in biosamples and bioassays, aimed at understanding the requirements, capabilities and limitations 
of assays.
For both in vivo and in vitro conditions, there are distinct example questions the tool can help you with. These are described in detail in the accompanying publication.
The graphical user interfac developed in R-shiny allows a user-friendly exploration of the model via several graphs and the ability to vary the model's parameters.

# Getting Started
Deploy code using R studio of cloud-based hosting solution. See accompanying publication for stepwise instructions


# Contribute
